Addition to the Results File:
The first line of the file indicates whether the game is running with features enabled (1) or without features (0).

Defining Screen Completion:
Reaching the end of the screen means successfully getting to Pauline.
However, if you lose all your lives before the final screen, it will be considered as not completing the game, and an appropriate error message will be displayed.

Error Handling in Load and Silent Mode:
In loading mode, error messages are shown after running a screen, but only for screens with errors. Screens without errors run normally and proceed automatically to the next screen without messages.
If multiple errors exist in the results file, only the first error is shown before moving to the next screen.
In silent mode, only success or failure messages for each screen are displayedâ€”no gameplay is shown.
