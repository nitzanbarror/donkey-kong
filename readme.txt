Donkey Kong Console Game (C++ Project)

This C++ console game is a recreation of the classic "Donkey Kong" arcade game. 
The game is written using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
The player controls Mario, who must avoid ghosts and barrels thrown by Donkey Kong, climb ladders, and rescue Pauline. It is built for Windows using Visual Studio, utilizing functions like gotoxy, _kbhit, _getch, and Sleep.

Game Highlights:
Controls: a, d, w, x, s for movement of Mario, ESC to pause.
Barrels & Donkey Kong: Donkey Kong throws barrels (O) that Mario must avoid.
Ladders: Mario climbs ladders (H) to move between floors.
Rescue Pauline: Reach Pauline ($) to win.
Ghosts: Ghosts (x) move randomly and can harm Mario and some ghosts (X) can climb ladders.
Hammer: Mario can use a hammer (p) to destroy barrels and ghosts.
Save/Load: Save and load game states from text files.
How to Run: Compile and run in Visual Studio. Use command-line arguments to save/load games.

This project demonstrates C++ usage for creating interactive console games with file handling and dynamic gameplay.
