Behavior During Mario's Free Fall:
During Mario's free fall, we have implemented Option 3, based on a response in the course forum. 
This means the fall continues Mario's previous movement along the X-axis,
and the player can also control Marioâ€™s movement left or right using the arrow keys until he lands on a surface.

Barrel Explosion:
Based on a question from the course forum, we've decided that when a barrel reaches the edge of the screen, it should explode.
